Internship Task Overview with AICTE Oasis

During my internship with AICTE Oasis, I completed two programming tasks in Java, demonstrating my skills in problem-solving, logic building, and application development. Below is an overview of the two tasks:

Task 1: Number Guessing Game

The first task involved developing a Number Guessing Game in Java. The program generates a random number within a specified range, and the player is prompted to guess the number. Key features of the game include:





Random Number Generation: Utilized Javaâ€™s Random class to generate a random number for the player to guess.



User Input Handling: Implemented input validation to ensure the player enters valid numeric guesses.



Feedback Mechanism: Provided feedback to the player after each guess, indicating whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.



Game Loop: Allowed multiple guesses until the correct number was guessed, with an optional limit on the number of attempts.



Scoring System: Optionally tracked the number of attempts taken to guess the correct number, enhancing user engagement.

This task helped me strengthen my understanding of Java fundamentals, such as loops, conditionals, user input handling with Scanner, and basic game logic design.

Task 2: ATM Interface

The second task was to create an ATM Interface in Java, simulating the core functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine. The program provided a user-friendly interface to perform banking operations. Key features included:





User Authentication: Implemented a simple login system using a predefined PIN or user ID to simulate secure access.



Account Management: Supported basic operations like checking account balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money, with validation to prevent invalid transactions (e.g., withdrawing more than the available balance).



Transaction History: Optionally maintained a record of transactions (deposits and withdrawals) for the user to review.



Menu-Driven Interface: Designed an interactive console-based menu using loops and switch-case statements to allow users to select operations seamlessly.



Error Handling: Incorporated input validation and error messages to handle incorrect inputs or invalid operations.

This task enhanced my skills in object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, such as classes, objects, and methods, as well as logic for handling financial transactions and user interactions.

Summary

Both tasks, completed as part of my internship with AICTE Oasis, allowed me to apply Java programming concepts in practical scenarios. The Number Guessing Game focused on logic, user interaction, and iterative development, while the ATM Interface emphasized OOP principles, user interface design, and transaction management. These projects improved my coding proficiency, problem-solving abilities, and understanding of real-world application development.
